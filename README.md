## SnookerScore

### Scorekeeping application for snooker fans

This is a web-based open source snooker scorekeeping (marking) application for real-time score display at the table for the players and spectators.

All you need to mark and display the score are two internet connected devices (TV, computer, tablet or mobile phone).

Go to the free to use **[SnookerScore web site](http://snookerscore.vitkauskas.lt)** (or clone the depository and host the application on your own server if preferred), create a match by entering it's place and title, the names of the players and the number of frames to play - and you are good to go.

Just open a **View** link of the match for score display on one device and click the **Mark** link on another device to start the marking of the match. As you mark the score on your device, the score is automatically updated on all the other devices displaying the score in real-time.

## Usage

You mark the score by clicking the appropriately colored balls on the screen or pushing the buttons to mark fouls, break-offs and other actions. On computer, you can also use the keyboard shortcuts that are indicated on the left side of the buttons. Some buttons have more than one keyboard shortcut that are listed in the table bellow:

Action | Keyboard Shortcut | | Action | Keyboard Shortcut
:----: | :---------------: |---| :----: | :---------------:
Balls | **`1`**, **`2`**, **`3`**, **`4`**, **`5`**, **`6`**, **`7`** || Break Off | **`O`**
End Break | **`E`** | | Re-Rack | **`R`**
Foul 4 | **`F4`** or **`Ctrl`+`4`** | | Foul 5 | **`F5`** or **`Ctrl`+`5`**
Foul 6 | **`F6`** or **`Ctrl`+`6`** | | Foul 7 | **`F7`** or **`Ctrl`+`7`**
Miss | **`M`** | | Free Ball | **`F`**
Put Back | **`B`** | | Play Again | **`A`**
Red Lost | **`L`** | | Help | **`H`** or **`F1`**
Frame Won | **`W`** | | Conceded | **`C`**
Undo | **`U`** or **`Z`** | | Redo | **`D`** or **`Y`**

Hit **`ESC`** from anywhere you are to go back to the main page. Your score is always safe - you can always come back and continue from where you left.
